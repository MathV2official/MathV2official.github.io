This project does not require any servers, for the best expericance, I suggest 
using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) and cloning the repo into the
Apache Server directory at `C:\xampp\htdocs` (for windows) and set the port
to something like 8080 and open up a browser and point to `localhost:8080`
