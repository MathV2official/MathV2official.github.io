Turn off that cat video!</li><li>Close any file-sharing applications</li><li>Close apps that download in the background (Steam, etc.)</li><li>Try a different server</li><li>Restart your router</li><li>If you're on WiFi, try a wired connection if you can</li></ul><p>Generally speaking, we like to see a ping of 100ms or less. You can see your ping in the upper-right corner of the game window as you play. You can get away with higher pings if they're consistent.
