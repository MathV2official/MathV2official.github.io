My entry for JS13K 2019.

[SWAGSHOT] is intended to be a throwback at 90s first person shooters, when all that really mattered was to run and shoot countless faceless enemies.

The game features 5 different weapons:
- Pistol
- Rocket Launcher
- Shotgun
- Machine Gun
- Rail Gun

The goal is to score as many points as possible by eliminating robots on the station with style.
Points are awarded for performing different feats, such as killing enemies, making direct rocket hits, hitting while jumping, killing several enemies in a row.
